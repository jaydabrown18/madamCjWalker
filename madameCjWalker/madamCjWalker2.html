        <p>	I chose Madam CJ Walker because she made a huge contribution to the black community and just in America overall. She became a self-made millionaire and one of the first black millionaires. Walker has impacted young girls and helped contribute to uplifting young girls and celebrating the beauty of black hair. She also helped inspire other young black entrepreneurs to start creating their own businesses and one day become self-made millionaires. She helped so many black women feel confident about their hair. She even took the time to provide business opportunities to inspiring businesswomen. Walker helped people from the beginning. I love how she did not think about how much money she was going to make starting her business but instead helping the black community(more specifically black women) and made a name for herself in the process. The black community will forever be grateful for Madam C.J. Walker and her courage to start a business.</p>
        <p>Madam CJ Walker (Born Sarah Breedlove) is the first self-made black woman millionaire in America. She was born to enslaved parents on December 23, 1867.  She was inspired to start making hair care products because she was losing her hair, leading to her making “the Walker System.” She started making hair care products for black hair to promote hair growth and health. Once she mastered the method of creating hair care products and tested them on herself as well as friends, she started selling her products on the streets to people. Walker would even go as far as to deliver her products door to door to get herself out there. The Walker System is a series of steps used to style and protect the hair and scalp. These steps are scalp preparation, lotions, and iron comb. This system was performed at Walker’s salon where she owned Walker’s products was a huge success and eventually led to her getting her factory where she hired workers to start making the products for her in 1910.</p>
        <p>Walker was eventually recognized for her hair care products and was able to afford to live in an extremely nice house with her family. Once she moved into her house, she used her previous house as a salon for black women. Walker’s reputation began to rise when she began helping her community by providing jobs for black women due to there not being many during the time. She even created clubs, encouraged her employees to give back to their communities, and rewarded them for their hard work and help. She donated money to different black charities “funding scholarships for women at Tuskegee Institute and donating to the NAACP, the Black YMCA, and dozens of other organizations that helped make black history.” Walker died on May 25, 1919. Before her death, Walker planned to have a company in Indianapolis and was followed through even after she died in 1927. Today, she is remembered as a “pioneering black female entrepreneur and will always have an impact on the world for years to come.</p>
